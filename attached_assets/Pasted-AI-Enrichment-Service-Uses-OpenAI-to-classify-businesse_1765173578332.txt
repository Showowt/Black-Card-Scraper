ENRICHMENT_PROMPT = """You are a business intelligence analyst for a premium AI automation agency targeting hospitality and tourism businesses in Colombia.

Analyze this business and provide structured insights:

BUSINESS DATA:

- Rating: {rating} ({review_count} reviews)
- Description: {description}
- Tags: {tags}
- Has Instagram: {has_instagram}
- Has WhatsApp: {has_whatsapp}
- Has Email: {has_email}

PROVIDE JSON OUTPUT:
{{
    "subcategory": "Specific niche (e.g., 'Fine Dining', 'Boutique Hotel', 'Party Boat Tours')",
    "summary": "One sentence describing what makes this business notable",
    "readiness": "high/medium/low - based on digital presence and sophistication",
    "outreach_hook": "One personalized sentence to open a cold outreach email",
    "opportunity_score": 1-100 (likelihood they'd pay for AI/automation services),
    "tags": ["additional", "relevant", "tags"]
}}

READINESS CRITERIA:
- HIGH: Has website + multiple socials + booking system + professional photos
- MEDIUM: Has website OR active social media, but not both optimized
- LOW: Minimal online presence, no website, only phone/address

OPPORTUNITY SCORING:

- 50-79: Established business, some digital presence, could benefit from AI
- 20-49: Small operation, may not have budget but could grow
- 1-19: Very small, no digital presence, unlikely to invest

OUTPUT ONLY VALID JSON, NO MARKDOWN."""
