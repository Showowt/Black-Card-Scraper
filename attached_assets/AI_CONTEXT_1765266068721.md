3. **Instagram Discovery** - Finds business Instagram handles from websites and generates likely handles
4. **Signal Analysis** - Detects what each business needs based on their digital presence
5. **Custom Offer Generation** - Different pitch per business based on their specific problems
6. **Psychology-Engineered Outreach** - Copy-paste DMs, WhatsApp, emails using 4 frameworks

## KEY COMMANDS
```bash
python main.py scan -c Cartagena -cat restaurant -m 50     # Discover businesses
python main.py ultimate -c Cartagena --min-score 70        # Generate full outreach package
python main.py copilot                                      # Interactive AI assistant
python main.py respond "their message" -b "Business"       # Draft response
python main.py handle-objection "Es muy caro"              # Reframe objection
```

## PSYCHOLOGY FRAMEWORKS
1. **Neuroscience/NLP**: Emotion before logic, pattern interrupts, presuppositions
2. **Behavioral Economics**: Loss aversion (2.5x), anchoring, social proof, scarcity
3. **Identity Transformation**: "You didn't open a restaurant to be a receptionist"
4. **Compliance**: Authority markers, specific numbers, clear next steps
