### Instagram Discovery

The system tries multiple sources:

1. **Existing data** - From Google Places API or website scrape (HIGH confidence)
2. **Website scraping** - Looks for IG links on their site (HIGH confidence)
3. **Generated handles** - Creates likely handles like `lavitrola`, `lavitrola_cartagena` (LOW confidence - verify before sending)

**Dashboard shows confidence:**
- `📸 @lavitrola` = Found and verified
- `❌ No Instagram found` = Couldn't find, you'll need to search manually
